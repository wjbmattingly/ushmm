TECHNICAL CONVERSATION

A: But I will explain who is who. So this is my father. This is my mother. This is my older
brother, the physician. And this is my sister, and this is my younger brother, who were killed
in the war -- like in ghetto. They took them to concentration camp. This is the mother-in-law
of my youngest brother's wife. This is her mother and her father. They was together killed in
1942. Those taken to a concentration camp from ghetto. That's my close family. This is from
